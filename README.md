 ðŸ•Œ Faisal Mosque 3D Reconstruction Project

This project demonstrates *feature extraction* and *3D reconstruction* using computer vision techniques.  
It applies the *SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm* along with *camera calibration* to extract features from multiple images of Faisal Mosque.  
The reconstructed output can be visualized in *Blender* as a 3D model made of triangular meshes.

---

 ðŸš€ Features
- Extracts key feature points using *SIFT algorithm*.  
- Performs *camera calibration* for accurate reconstruction.  
- Builds a *3D triangular mesh* representation of Faisal Mosque.  
- Output can be visualized in *Blender*.  
  # Dataset
  This project uses a dataset of Faisal Mosque images for feature extraction and reconstruction.  

- A few *sample images* are included in the sample_images/ folder.  
- The *full dataset* is too large for GitHub. You can download it here:
